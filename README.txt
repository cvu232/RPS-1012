Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors
Similar to the Rock, Paper, Scissors example prompt in the document, the site will allow users to choose which RPS symbol they want, display if either they or the server won, and allow the user to play best out of 3. Building off of that, a UI that allows the user to set up the settings of the game will be implemented for more organization (restart, music on/off, etc).


Phase 1:
Requirements:

Languages Used:
HTML: Display
CSS: Aesthetic
JS: Calculations & Functionality

CSS Design:
Images for Buttons will be visible in CSS format
Images of rocks, papers, scissors may be outsourced from Google.
Different colours of each button will be determined in CSS: (Red for rock, green for paper, blue for scissors)
Leaderboard colours and design will be visible in the CSS format
Borders created for both the player side and server side visible in CSS format
Borders color & width setting will be visible in CSS format

HTML Display
Brief instructions on how the game is played and how the game will run will be visible in HTML format
Class or ID for the buttons to be set visible in HTML format
Class or ID for the Leaderboards to be set visible in HTML format 
Class or ID for the player name input to be set visible in HTML format
Class or ID for the output to be set visible in the HTML format

JS Functions
Allow users to input names. 
How can we get the html/js to remember names and for how long?
A high score function will be established under “ highscore()” function in JS
“names()” function will allow for players to record and view their personal high scores in Js (Player Name input function).
Button functions in JS format:
 “Rock”/“Paper”/“Scissors”
“Highscores”
“Leaderboard”
“Play Again”
“Cancel”/“Enter”
“Exit”/“Home”
“Yes”/”No”
Game ends when player loses function established in JS using booleans
Win-lose calculations for RPS will be determined in JS under “sort” function
The use of while loops or if statements to determine a winner will be established under the “Rock” ,”paper”, “Scissors” functions each will have their own cases to their own outcomes in JS format

Server choices will be calculated using a randomized function	
Randomizer function will be established under “random” function in JS format
Write programs in Js that can manipulate the style sheet of a player(s), based on conditions such as who is winning, losing, winning streak, etc.
Option to “Play again” with the same user, where both users must agree on specific conditions (“Yes”/No) in order to play again.







Other ideas (Advanced):
Live chat (node.js)
Randomize images of rocks, papers, scissors with every new interaction
