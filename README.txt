Project: Rock, Paper, Scissors
Similar to the Rock, Paper, Scissors example prompt in the document, the site will allow users to choose which RPS symbol they want, display if either they or the server won, and allow the user to play best out of 3. Building off of that, a UI that allows the user to set up the settings of the game will be implemented for more organization (restart, music on/off, etc). Users will be able to play an endless mode with the server, where the player can stack up wins until they end up losing. Once they lose, the screen will head into a leaderboard where players can see the high scores. If the player created a new high score, they will be able to input their name for the session.


Functional Requirements:

- Two modes of RPS will be available as a menu. Choosing either or will take you to the same game screen aesthetically, but functionally different.
- Player vs. Server and Player vs Player style for this site.
- Three buttons will exist with "rock", "paper", "scissor" options for players to make their choice on the left side (player side).
- Right side will also have three buttons similar to the left side to display the server's choice (to provide visual feedback).
- Display images or gifs to represent when a user wins game, wins round, loses round, or gets a game over.
- A header will display "player" on the left side and "CPU" on the right side.
- Normal mode will allow best of 5 matches with the server.
- Endless mode will use a counter to keep track of number of wins the player gets before losing their streak.
- After losing in endless mode, leaderboard screen is then displayed. If player set a highscore, players will be able to input their name on the board.
- Users will be able to either "return to menu" or "play again" through buttons at the bottom of the screen.
- Music will be played to add some flavour to the gameplay.
